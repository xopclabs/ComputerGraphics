# Laboratory work â„– 6
## Realistic scenes

For the sake of simplicity, this demo uses single directional parallel light source with flat polygonal shading.

Pressing *x*, *y*, *z* toggles corresponding axis. Scrolling mouse wheel changes angle of rotation around toggled axis. Pressing *LMB* or *RMB* rotates sphere around toggled axis. 

Pressing *left*/*right* and *up*/*down* arrow keys move light source along *x*/*y* axis. Pressing *c*/*d* moves light source along *z* axis. Pressing *q*/*w* increases/decreases intensity of the light source.
